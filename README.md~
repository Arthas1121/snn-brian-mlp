# snn-brian-mlp

This is a multi perceptron layer being built using brian and learned using supervised learning.


- opencv (cv2) with brian slows down the process. Use diffrent file to read the image and call the function in the main file.

- Initialization of weights is very important. Lesser the spiking activity, better it is for the network.
